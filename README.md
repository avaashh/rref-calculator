# RREF Calculator

## Overview

The RREF Calculator is a tool for converting a given matrix into its Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). The RREF is a standard form that simplifies matrices and is particularly useful in solving systems of linear equations.

This project is also deployed on [my website](https://avaash.com.np/rref).

## Features

- **Matrix Size Input:** Enter a matrix of any size.
- **Step-by-Step Solution:** View the step-by-step transformations as the matrix is reduced to its RREF.
- **Row Operations:** Understand each step with detailed row operations displayed.
- **Efficient Handling:** Optimized algorithm to efficiently compute the RREF.
- **Result in LaTex:** Step-by-step operations are shown in LaTex on the browser, along with copyable Tex.

## Usage

1. **Input Matrix:** Enter the matrix you want to transform into RREF.
2. **Compute RREF:** Click the "Compute RREF" button to initiate the calculation.
3. **Step-by-Step View:** Explore each step of the process with detailed row operations.
4. **Final RREF Matrix:** The entire process, including the final RREF matrix is displayed in LaTex on the browser.

## Example

### Input:

```
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
[7 8 9]
```

### Output:

```
[1 0 -1]
[0 1 2]
[0 0 0]
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avaashh/rref-calculator.git
```

Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
